Hello,
I've done something very technical, added 0xf0000 to all the "ASCII based" range in the 2008 OTF-SIL provided font.

Attaching:
 .sfd - this is the 'FontForge' format I think, for editing
 .woff - the compiled output

and my own test page: .html + .css

Opening them on my system works , even though FontForge gives warnings on the .woff compilation,
I do not suggest that this will be any distributed form of the Beria-PUA encoding, it's just I'm going on vacation this Friday, and after-which some job related travel, I'll probably only be able to play with this things again at about the 15th of May ...
But, since it takes a-bit of fiddling to setup the encoding, I hope Craig can only try playing with this PUA reencoded version already;
Tomorrow, I'll try to install this font on Android and MacOS (I've done this on my linux box, I wasn't able to run FontForge on my Macbook btw)
I'm curious whether installing this font system-wide (locally, manually) - will make the PUA chars render as Beria, like if I paste PUA in this very email:
whether it can show as Beria on my Android device gmail client, etc;

here :)

 󰁡 󰁢 󰁣 󰁤 󰁥 󰁦 󰁧 󰁨 󰁩 󰁪

You guys are right, my further questions are already not font related, these are very good pointers on the Quora question etc (what happens on ^f ;;;;)
this is more important at a later stage;

Also, regarding search-engine etc, the thing is, there is no written corpus being used now afaik, ask Andrew of course about this (hopefully we can get some bible fragments! )
but I think it's much more critical for people to start using the language online, if the script pushes this forward, so be it, the "political" timing with the current Sudan "Spring" - might be right for that (Sadik is involved in some support march for that now), as some of the young Fur asylum seekers now start families in diaspora now, this affects language transmission, and language prestige within the communities, at least that's something that needs to be checked.

Cheers!
